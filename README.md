# lua2js

A Lua to JS transpiler

Usage example (I am using it just to convert a lua file to js; run the temporary js file and get some data from it):
```
const fs = require('fs')
const lua2js = require('lua2js')
const execSync = require('child_process').execSync

const data = lua2js.parser.parse(mainFileData)
fs.writeFileSync('./temp.js', `
  require("lua2js").runtime;
  ${data}
  require("fs").writeFileSync('./temp.json', JSON.stringify(Tget($get($, 'data'), 'raw').toObject(), null, 2));
`)
execSync('node temp.js')
```
